 üõ†Ô∏è Requirements:

 To get CineLingo up and running, you'll need the following:

   - **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed.
   - **ffmpeg**: A powerful multimedia framework. (Installation example: 
         Ubuntu: sudo apt install ffmpeg)
   - **Python Libraries:**
       - `whisper` (from OpenAI) for transcription.
       - `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1` for translation.
       - `tqdm` for progress visualization.

 Install the required Python packages with:

     pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
     pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
     pip install tqdm

 ==============================================================================

 üéØ How It Works:

 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Audio Extraction:**  
     CineLingo kicks things off by extracting a crystal-clear audio track from your 
     video using ffmpeg. This is the foundation for precise transcription.

 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Transcription with Whisper:**  
     Next, it deploys the OpenAI Whisper model to transform the audio into text. 
     Not only do you get the dialogues, but each line comes with exact timestamps ‚Äì 
     perfect for creating SRT files.

 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Translation:**  
     With an intuitive selection of languages, CineLingo lets you choose your desired 
     target language from an extensive list. Using Google Translate, every line is 
     skillfully translated into the language you need.

 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Profanity Filtering:**  
     Worried about maintaining a kid-friendly tone? No problem! CineLingo 
     automatically checks for profanities using a customizable profanity mapping file 
     (e.g., `profanity_map_sq.txt` for Albanian) and replaces them with gentler, family‚Äê
     friendly alternatives.

 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Output:**  
     All of the above magic culminates in a polished SRT file ready to be merged back 
     into your video or distributed on its own.

 ==============================================================================

 üìö How to Use CineLingo:

 Step 1: Open your terminal and run the script with your video file:

         python script.py path_to_your_video_file.mp4

 Step 2: You'll be presented with a vibrant list of available languages. Simply enter 
         the number corresponding to your desired target language.

         Tip: If you have a custom profanity file for your language (e.g., 
         "profanity_map_<language_code>.txt"), make sure it's in the same directory. 
         This file should contain mappings in the format: 
                english_profanity:target_language_replacement

 Step 3: Sit back as the tool extracts the audio, transcribes the dialogue, translates 
         everything into your chosen language, and applies the profanity filter.

 Step 4: Voila! CineLingo outputs a stunning SRT file with transformed subtitles 
         tailored to your international audience.
